# DSN_PreBootcamp_Hackathon
This is my solution for the DSN Pre-bootcamp 2020.

This repository contains my solution (19th position) for the Pre-Bootcamp hackathon organised by Data Science Nigeria (DSN) on Zindi, from 8 August—22 August, 2020. (link to hackathon: https://zindi.africa/hackathons/dsn-pre-bootcamp-hackathon-expresso-churn-prediction-challenge).

## Objective:
Expresso is an African telecommunications company that provides customers with airtime and mobile data bundles. The objective of this challenge is to develop a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of each Expresso customer “churning,” i.e. becoming inactive and not making any transactions for 90 days. Thus helping Expresso to better serve their customers by understanding which customers are at risk of leaving.
